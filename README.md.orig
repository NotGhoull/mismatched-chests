# Mismatched chests

Mismatched Chests is a simple mod that allows you to combine two chests of different wood types to create a double chest, as if they were the same. It's designed to work with other mods that add new chests, such as [LieOnLion's More chest variants mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-chest-variants-lieonlion), so you can have an oak chest, and a cherry chest side-by-side and still have them function as a single, double chest!
